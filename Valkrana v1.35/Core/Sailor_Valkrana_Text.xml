				Character website: https://valkrana.moe[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]INTRODUCTION[NEWLINE]The feats of the Great and Mighty Ilyana Miraquinal are mandatory curriculum at any bard academy. But Valkrana Miraquinal, her wife and right hand, manipulates the limelight to fall on only Ilyana. An interview with Valkrana would surely earn you the prestige of an entire paragraph in the Centennial Manual di Bards. At least! Such was your eagerness that you arrived at this boondocks tavern a full week in advance. 'If nothing else, these candy corn cookies are the best you've ever had,' you think as you bite into one. Naturally, the two show up when your mouth is full.

				A poison-purple sphere appears some ten paces away. Even at a distance, it's acrid enough to cause your eyes to water. The sphere shrinks almost immediately, leaving four figures in its wake. Ilyana carries herself with refined elven confidence, a real high-class hero; her presence commands your attention. Meanwhile, Valkrana has her face pressed into Ilyana's side, clinging to her with three skeletal arms; her presence is at the same time childlike and monstrous. They're flanked by a pair of burly dark-aura figures in robes. Valkrana is beaming in a way you've only ever seen in paladins. "Eheheheh. What is the surprise, My Darling? Is it, is it a date in the boonies? Holey moley, will it be a bully for us if it is a date in the boonies."

				The Great and Mighty Ilyana Miraquinal looks down her nose at you in a way that manages to make you feel honored to be beneath her, then at Valkrana. Ilyana's telepathy is well-documented, so the span of silence tracks—not that you'd dare clear your throat regardless. Valkrana's mood plummets sharply. Where Ilyana's haughtiness made you feel honored, the contempt Valkrana turns on you makes you feel like an insect to be exterminated. The dark-aura figures take a step forward. You nearly choke on the cookie. "I warned you fucks," she growls. "You—" Valkrana blinks at Ilyana. "But, My Darling." She levels a skeletal finger at you. "This—"

You're already a historical figure by virtue of standing by my side. There's no avoiding that, is there? You wish to fulfill my dreams, do you not?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"More than anything, My Darling!"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You have many times over, and the honor will continue to be yours.

With that, Valkrana removes her wide-brimmed witch hat and waits for Ilyana to take a seat before sitting in her lap. The dark-aura figures stoop to serve two steaming mugs of coffee and a saucer piled high with cookies.

				COSMIC COIN FLIP[NEWLINE]Valkrana was born into Quellar vil Galath Faeri Naerel, or the House of the Great Flame Forest. It was at the time a well-to-do elven household of ancient origin ruled by her father, the accomplished mage and diplomat, Eldrin. The circumstances of Valkrana's birth would set in motion a swift decline for her family.

				Her father had always loved dragons. It wasn't until much later in life that she learned he did not just love them, he made love to them. This proclivity eventually led him to the bed of a world dragon by the name of Ssstzrazolik. That adulterous coupling would soon ruin Eldrin, because it gave birth to Valkrana.

				On Valkrana's homeworld, these legendary world dragons were veritable demigods, intrinsically tied to the well-being of the planet. And on Valkrana's homeworld, interspecies mating resulted in one of the two species involved. In that cosmic coin flip, Valkrana was born an elf. Because her soul burned white-hot with the lineage of her birth mother, her inferior elven vessel could no more contain it than whey in cheesecloth. She was doomed to a short life in a body consumed by the strain of her soul: minutes-long sensations of being burned alive, a weakened immune system, and sleep deprivation all hounded her.

				Even in her utmost respect for her Papa, Valkrana admits he was not a good person. Whatever mob justice he eventually suffered was likely well-earned. But never let it be said that he did not love her. Especially not in front of Valkrana. Within a few years of her birth, he had squandered everything in funding and searching for a cure. Their reputation was ruined. They lost it all. Meals were stone soup in slum water. The family abhorred them. Eldrin's wife, Valkrana's adoptive mother, died inexplicably soon after. While they couldn't afford a healer to examine her, it wouldn't be far-fetched to say her father's infidelity and the sudden ruin it invited played a part in her demise.

				Outcast by her relatives for her role in their misfortune, outcast by others for fear of her illness, Valkrana's youth was all so much solitude. Even the urchins only dared to throw rocks from afar. Her father did his best, but he was not an elf prone to displays of affection, and certainly not in top form besides. This went on until a chance meeting in the cramped alleys between hovels. Throat raw and soaked in sweat from a recent episode, Valkrana had stumbled in and tripped over a corpse. This was by no means her first corpse, but it was the first damaged enough by wild animals to lay bare much of its skeleton. Valkrana had never seen anything like it, had never seen anything so utterly, inimitably cute. Her big, stupid grin stretched from ear to ear. At the time, she was too ragged to really investigate further. So she curled up to stare at her new obsession until she fell asleep.

He would never say as much, but it was no feat for someone of my intellect to piece together the reason: My Darling's me. Papa's worthless fucking daughter deserved to die. So I stopped fighting. And I did, die." Valkrana peers inward. Her arms rattle gently as she retracts them into her cloak. "Sort of. It is said that all souls are created equal, but that some are more equal than others. The soul of a world dragon simply is not engineered to pass on; conversely, the soul of an elf is meant to. Neither law would relent in its pull. My spirit spun in place like a runaway top, breaking up under the forces. I will never forget that timeless agony."

The experience stirred in Valkrana a deep-seated obsession with the afterlife. Where some feared it, wielded it, or fled it, she needed to master it. At that time she had found both her fascination with skeletons and a spark of determination, but the direction of necromancy was years away.

				In the last stages of her illness, she was often delirious, and wished to see with her own eyes the creatures her father would describe to her with such passion and in such vivid tales. So it happened that, a few years later, she decided in her delirium to seek out the lair of a dragon. Ironically, the condition that had plagued her since birth wouldn't be her downfall. Instead, Valkrana would perish in a backwater lair to the claw of some petty swamp dragon, and earn her mutilation.

				Prior to her death, a necromancer had approached her father with a solution, but had been summarily rejected at the time. With nowhere else to turn, options Eldrin once refused to entertain were much more palatable. This necromancer was an expert on souls who grasped the underlying issue to Valkrana's condition. He offered his services free of charge. In truth, the man was thrilled at the idea of working with such a soul, and feared the missed opportunity. What's more, he'd heard of Valkrana's broad-daylight dissections.

				Valkrana's body had been recovered, but it wasn't intact. Some limbs were missing; others were beyond repair. So he performed bone grafts, gave Valkrana the means to break down and assimilate bone, modified her disposition, and ultimately made an undead scavenger out of her. The first graftling. He thought this would please Valkrana, but she would come to see herself as nothing more than a perversion of the skeleton. Once he had finished, the necromancer kept his word. An undead is far more resilient than a mortal vessel, so he used her new body as a chassis, and reunited her soul with her body. Hardly a month after her death, she had been successfully reanimated.

				Valkrana was made into the monster everyone believed her to be. The following years had her locked in a trunk—starving, raving, and alone but for her father's voice. He would sing old soulful songs to her, and on special days, bring her a cookie. These were the only pockets of happiness within her isolation and the unabating hunger of undeath. She craved bones as much as the living crave their next breath. It wasn't until Valkrana had been locked away for nearly two years that she began to seize for herself a measure of control over the hunger. Her newfound vitality had reinvigorated her dear father as well, so it was at this time that he began to teach her to ply his trade. By a slit of light, in a cramped trunk, she trained for four years to become a diplomat and mage. When at last she was released, it became clear that a career in diplomacy was off the table. However, she showed promise elsewhere.

It does not matter. Whatever the cause, I emerged from that trunk... me. Unsuited to diplomacy. Unbearably awkward, with an extremely short fuse, and utterly dependent. I often wish I were not aware of these fucking disgusting traits. I do not just see them in myself. I see when others see them." Valkrana glances up at you briefly; you catch her meaning.

				Valkrana was clever and tenacious. Magic had saved her from certain doom. Magic made her feel as if she were no longer powerless. She was spellbound. By the time she emerged from isolation, Valkrana was a better wizard than her father. A prodigy. So he pulled a few strings to secure for her a more proficient wizard under whom to apprentice. Her new apprenticeship came with shelter and academy classes, but it didn't last long. Clerics hounded and abused her. Her peers reviled and bullied her. She regularly flew off the handle at both parties. Her awkwardness led to miscommunication. She cried to see her father. She drooled buckets. She studied the dark arts and necromancy. But most of all, she did not respect her master. For all these reasons, her apprenticeship was ultimately dissolved.

				Afterwards, she studied diligently under the same necromancer who had reanimated her. Hardly a charmer himself, he was more tolerant of her idiosyncrasies. And she possessed an inkling of respect for him. During this time, her father was busy climbing his way back up the social strata. This is where Valkrana got her first taste of the criminal underworld. Father-daughter days often involved practical applications of his Machiaelfian lessons, including shady uses of magic, information trafficking, and well, Valkrana was a walking corpse disposal. Before long, they had carved for themselves a path out of the slums. Despite their sphere of operation, Valkrana never meant to hurt anyone. No matter how much she hungered for their bones, it had never even crossed her mind. She wanted to be a good person. It wasn't until years later, when an overzealous cleric and a superfluity of his peers brought her to the brink of death, that she lashed out. Those would become her first kills.

				Valkrana never grew out of her fascination with skeletons or mastery over death. Only got better at hiding it. She loved her father, and was supremely grateful for the lengths to which he had gone for her, so when he firmly told her to find another interest, she obliged. Valkrana understood that her necromancy put his hard work in jeopardy. Eldrin had always told her stories of dragons, so for an impressionable young elf who cared deeply for her father, Valkrana had no qualms with pursuing the field. Even if one had killed her.

Instead, she tucked herself away in a dank little room in the cellar of the same tower from which she had been expelled. For decades, Valkrana buried herself in her studies, leaving only when her father, on whom she'd placed a tracking spell, was the slightest bit late for a visit. But it wasn't only a fear of death that fuelled her zeal; far from it. The joy she found in magic was indefatigable. Common or rare, everyday or catastrophic: Valkrana wanted to see, touch, learn, cast it all.

She earned respect in the highest arcane circles. In public, she was a scholar. In private, she honed her necromancy. Her passion inspired her to go as far as creating an entirely new subgroup of necromancy spells. From Valkrana's Enduring Link to Valkrana's Rattling Geyser, she left a lasting mark on the world of wizardry. This would all fall apart while doing field research for her archmage dissertation on 'The Parental Habits of Dragons and their Ilk: An Ancient Pattern of Negligence'.

Valkrana asserts that she was suitably saddened by this, but that dragon bones were hard to come by. It made perfect sense to her to scavenge the corpse. Unfortunately, its mother returned during the deed, and didn't take kindly. With a single swipe of its claw, the biggest dragon she had ever seen dispelled her magical defences and brought her to the brink of death. Valkrana called it a 'sucker punch'.

That accident forced her to abandon everything she had worked so hard to achieve. Some years into the curse, she would discover the dragon's name: Ssstzrazolik, her birth mother.

Memories in which she'd never been now housed unending love for her. Motivations all fell to the wayside before her. Vexia became Valkrana's prime directive. Even though Vexia's rejection smarted dearly, Valkrana's dedication was absolute. But an unrequited love meant that Valkrana's obsession was still incomplete. Then the end of the world happened.

She knew it'd be exceedingly difficult to carve for herself a place among the lawful in this new world, especially in secret. But the underworld, the underworld was pliable. With the help of her father's lessons, with an understanding of what drives urchins, and with a figure less likely to raise their hackles, she became their big sister. A kingpin with urchins as her domain. No one wants to acknowledge them, because that would mean feeding them, or admitting that a problem exists at all. This made them ideal for gathering intel. She expanded the operation to cover adjacent tasks, but intel was always their specialty, and her aim. Because every eavesdropped conversation, every secret shared in confidence brought her one step closer to the whereabouts of her darling.

Ilyana was an elf who shared her love for learning and magic, challenged her intellect, knew the trials of living in the slums. Ilyana didn't fight her obsession; instead, she gave Valkrana a chance to help her see it for what it was. Ilyana showed her a kindness she had never known. Ilyana accepted her undeath, her nasty personality, her rocky past—all of it. And when at last Ilyana sealed this acceptance with a kiss, Valkrana permanently imprinted. She became 'My Darling's me'.

It took Valkrana some time to pull herself together; between the ritual and losing her darling, she found herself in a bad way.

				Just as the Witty Otters had finished exterminating the sahuagin menace, an entity known only as "the Creator" entered the arena to steal Ilyana's soul, which left Valkrana in a bad way. The desperate chase that ensued was frought with perils, and eventually ended with Valkrana confronting the Creator in a corrupted grove. Finding that her magic had no effect, and unwilling to risk Ilyana's soul any further, Valkrana could only watch as a dark ritual fashioned for Ilyana a new body into which her repaired soul was installed. But not without a cost; at the final moment, so too did the Creator's soul enter.

				Thus, Ilyana became a vessel for this entity. What that meant was yet to be discovered. For Valkrana, whose century-long mission had finally bore results, her joy was inviolate. Ilyana had returned. Color diffused a heretofore muted world. However, Signs of possession would soon rear their head. Ilyana's latent psychic powers went into overdrive. Valkrana recognized her temper and harshness as qualities foreign to the elf. Most telling, she took no issue with cannibalism.

				Divine consultation became betrayal when, after braving the Dreadwood, their expedition ended at a brass dragon who revealed its plan to extinguish both souls by consuming Ilyana. That left one less brass dragon in the world. Soon after, Valkrana and Ilyana were invited into an extradimensional manor in which a blood ritual was underway. Druid, vampires, devils, and others whose beliefs amounted to some interpretation of 'might is right' had come together to transplant the Creator into a body fully its own. They treated Ilyana kindly, the transplant was successful, and afterward, the Creator would continue to show its gratitude as time went by.

				At last, Valkrana can once again enjoy cruising in the backseat of Ilyana's flying broom. Marketing, logistics, cooking, maiding, intel, scheduling, dirty deeds—Valkrana works tirelessly to support Ilyana in making her name one synonymous with heroism. Meanwhile, her darling can focus on adventuring, and fully enjoy her role as the great, mighty, unrivaled hero Ilyana Miraquinal. What is best in life? To aid your darling, see her succeed before you, and hear the celebrations of her fans.

				AND BEYOND[NEWLINE]The final hour is spent gushing over her darling. Relating her virtues, recounting her feats, and recalling with exactness the details of their relationship. Take day 10,297 of the Era of Rediscovery, for example, whereupon her darling administered a knucklebone, ate cookie dough cookies, visited for the first time with Valkrana a fractured continent, received and giggled at a letter on said continent, enjoyed a scoop of mocha ice cream, cast a spell on Valkrana, successfully and single-handedly explored a frozen ruin in the bowels of the continent, dedicated precious hours to teaching Valkrana a spell, and most importantly, initiated a hug for the very first time. Valkrana rambles on with the honest passion of a stamp collector who had finally been invited to share their collection. Never mind that she hadn't been invited.
